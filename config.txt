#2.column name projections. A comma-separated list that maps your column names to this pipeline's. The values (strings
#AFTER the colons) are YOUR dataset's column names, and the keys (strings BEFORE the colons) are the ones used in the
#tool. The keys are mandatory and have to all be specified. The order does not matter here.
#Mandatory keys: crosslinked peptide_a (pep_a), crosslinked peptide_b (pep_b), crosslinked residue position_a (pos_a),
#crosslinked residue position_b (pos_b), position of crosslinked residue in peptide_a (res_pos_a), position of
#crosslinked residue in peptide_b (res_pos_b), UniProt ID of protein belonging to peptide_a (unip_id_a), UniProt ID of
#protein belonging to peptide_b (unip_id_b).
#type: string
#ex.: pep_a:peptide_a, pep_b:peptide_b, pos_a:position_a, pos_b:position_b, res_pos_a:residue_pos_in_peptide_a, res_pos_b:residue_pos_in_peptide_b, unip_id_a:entry_a, unip_id_b:entry_b
projections = pep_a:peptide1, pep_b:peptide2, pos_a:position1, pos_b:position2, res_pos_a:k_pos1, res_pos_b:k_pos2, unip_id_a:entry1, unip_id_b:entry2

#3.read some results from temporary save from previous run (overwritten each time)
#type: boolean
#ex.: True
read_temps = False

#4.tiny comma-separated list of possibly crosslinked residues, as one-letter-code symbols, by the crosslinker.
#Optionally the user may add a ':' and either 1 if the residue has to be at the N-terminus or -1 if the residue has to
#be at the C-terminus. If you want to specify multiple possible positions for the same symbol you have to add them
#individually (ex.: "M:1,M:-1"). If the user does not add either the aminoacid is presumed to be position unspecific and
#may be accepted anywhere in the protein sequence.

#ex.: K,M:1 #for Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) linker

#13.strictness for euclidean distance, e.g. value substracted from euclidean distance in angstrom for confidence score
#calculation, or None if euclidean score is not to be included into the final scoring (in which case only the
#topological distance and OPS analysis are included)
#type: float [0,infty) / None
#ex.: None
euclidean_strictness = 5.0

#14.distance maximum which, if surpassed, by either the topological or euclidean distance replaces its value for the
