#type: string
#ex.: /home/me/desktop/my_outputs
output_directory = data/out/full

#3.column name projections. A comma-separated position-sensitive list that names the column names of the users dataset
#containing the necessary information for the tool. The column names should contain and should be given in the following
#order: crosslinked peptide_a, crosslinked peptide_b, crosslinked residue position_a, crosslinked residue position_b,
#position of crosslinked residue in peptide_a, position of crosslinked residue in peptide_b, UniProt ID of protein
#belonging to peptide_a, UniProt ID of protein belonging to peptide_b. Note: The positions of the crosslinked residue in
#the peptides are information only accessed, if the given full sequence positions do not match into the retrieved
#UniProt sequence. If the positions are confirmed you may simply create two substitute columns for the positions in the
#peptides instead and leave them empty.
#type: string
#ex.: peptide_a,peptide_b,position_a,position_b,residue_pos_in_peptide_a,residue_pos_in_peptide_b,entry_a,entry_b
projections = peptide1,peptide2,position1,position2,k_pos1,k_pos2,entry1,entry2

#4.read some results from temporary save from previous run (overwritten each time)
#type: boolean
#ex.: True

#5.tiny comma-separated list of possibly crosslinked residues, as one-letter-code symbols, by the crosslinker.
#Optionally the user may add a ':' and either 1 if the residue has to be at the N-terminus or -1 if the residue has to
#be at the C-terminus. If you want to specify multiple possible positions for the same symbol you have to add them
#individually (ex.: "M:1,M:-1"). If the user does not add either the aminoacid is presumed to be position unspecific and
#may be accepted anywhere in the protein sequence.

#calculation, or None if euclidean score is not to be included into the final scoring (in which case only the
#topological distance and OPS analysis are included)
#type: float [0,infty) / None
#ex.: None
euclidean_strictness = None

#15.distance maximum which, if surpassed, by either the topological or euclidean distance replaces its value for the
#confidence score (this ensures that outliers do not negatively impact the scoring)
