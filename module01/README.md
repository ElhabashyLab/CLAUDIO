# Module 01 - Unique protein (pair) listing tool

### The CLI - Command Line Interface
```
> python3 claudio_lists.py [-i <filepath>] [-p <"projection_dict">] [-s <True/False>] [-t <"blastp"/"hhsearch">] [-o <directorypath>] [-bl <directorypath>] [-bldb <directorypath>] [-hh <directorypath>] [-hhdb <directorypath>] [-hhout <directorypath>] 

-i,    --input-filepath,        path to inputfile,
                                default="data/in/liu18_schweppe17_linked_residues_intra-homo_2370_nonredundant.csv"
-p,    --projections,           string which can be parsed as dictionary, containing the column names for the uniprot 
                                entry columns (for naming convention see second example (Note: "unip_id_a", "unip_id_b",
                                "pep_a", "pep_b", "pos_a" and "pos_b" are mandatory)), 
                                default=str(liu18_schweppe17_linked_residues_intra_homo_2370_nonredundant_unique)
-s,    --uniprot_search,        if the tool has been run before with the same input a temporary file was saved, which 
                                can be used to retrieve the previouse results of the uniprot and structure searches. In 
                                this case you can set uniprot_search=False and it will try to retrieve said temporary 
                                save file, instead of rerunning the uniprot sequence search, default=False
-t,    --search-tool,           can be either "blastp" or "hhsearch", specifying the tool which should be used for pdb 
                                search, default="blastp"
-o,    --output-directory,      output directory for produced csv-files, default="data/out/unique_protein_list"
-bl,   --blast-bin,             binary directory in blast installation, or None if binary directory has been added to 
                                PATH variable (e.g. if blast can be called from anywhere), default=None
-bldb, --blast-db,              database directory for blast installation, default="$BLASTDB"
-hh,   --hhsearch-bin,          binary directory in hh-suite installation, or None if binary directory has been added to
                                PATH variable (e.g. if hhsearch can be called from anywhere), default=None
-hhdb, --hhsearch-db,           database directory for hh-suite installation, default="$HHDB"
-hhout,--hhsearch-out,          output directory for hhsearch results, default="$HHOUT"
```
### Input
This tool requires a CSV-file containing multiple observed cross-linking interactions. Two columns have to contain 
uniprot ids for each interacting residue, two columns have to contain the observed peptides for each interacting residue
and two columns have to contain the crosslinked residue's position within the full sequence (alternative: fill these with
Nans, but add two columns with the residue's positions in the respective peptides).\
It is recommended to start the analysis of your cross-linking dataset here, if you do not run the full pipeline. Most 
important for this first step is the customization of the parameter "-p / --projections". This parameter requires a 
python dictionary as input, which maps the column names of your dataset to the ones used in the tool. You may see 
examples for this in [this module](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/module01/src/dict/default_projections.py)
or in the [example configuration-file](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/config.txt).

### Output
This tool will return three CSV-files and one LOG-file. One contains a list of all unique proteins, their full uniprot sequences,
additional information retrieved from uniprot, their pdb id and the number of occurences in the inputfile, while the 
second contains a list of all unique interaction pairs, their pdb ids and the number of occurences of this pair in the 
inputfile. The final CSV-file will have the extension '.sqcs', which marks it as the input for module02 or module03. The
LOG-file lists eventual issues or errors in cross-linked residue positions in the inputfile that had to be changed/fixed
for the output.

### Example
The project can be run like this:
```
python3 claudio_lists.py
```
This will result in three CSV-files in "data/out/unique_protein_list" pertaining the project's default dataset 
'liu18_schweppe17_linked_residues_intra-homo_2370_nonredundant.csv'.
```
python3 claudio_lists.py -i "c/user/documents/cross_links.csv -p "{'my_entry1': 'unip_id_a', 'my_entry2': 'unip_id_b'}" -t "hhsearch" -o "c/user/documents/outs"
```
This will result in two csv-files in "c/user/documents/outs" for the placeholder 'cross_links.csv'.
