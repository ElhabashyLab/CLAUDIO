                                    2: write progressbars (where implemented)
                                    3: write alignments during data processing, and write extra information on process results

                                    5: write verfications during uniprot to pdb position translation
```

### Input
This tool requires a CSV-file containing multiple observed cross-linking interactions. Two columns have to contain 
UniProt IDs for each interacting residue, two columns the observed peptides for each interacting residue,
two columns the crosslinked residue's position within the full sequence (alternative: fill these with
Nans, but add two columns with the residue's positions in the respective peptides), two columns with the UniProt sequences,
and one column with the initial cross-link type estimation.\
It is recommended to start the analysis of your dataset with [module01](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/module01),
which will generate said CSV-file with the extension '.sqcs'. If you wish to skip this step though, or if you customized
the output file used as input here, check this list to ensure that you can run this module:
* file has to have the extension '.sqcs'
* file is formatted like a normal CSV-file
* file has columns "unip_id", "pep_a", "pep_b", "seq", "pos_a", "pos_b", "res_pos_a", "res_pos_b", 
each filled with information (in that order) of UniProt IDs [strings], peptides [strings], UniProt sequences [strings], 
crosslinked residue positions in full UniProt sequences [integers], and (alternative to normal positions) positions of 
the crosslinked residue in the peptides [integers].

### Output
This tool will return a directory full of pdb structure files, which were necessary for the computation, a CSV-file 
ending with the extension '.sqcs_structdi.csv', which is the result of the structure search including the 
structural distance computation's results, two histogram PNG-files depicting the computed structural distances and their
differences, and two more which depict the experimental methods and their resolution for each pdb structure.

### Example
This module can be run like with default parameters on the sample dataset:
```
claudio_structdi
```
This will result in a directory called 'structures' in "test/out/sample" filled with pdb structures, two 
histograms describing their resolutions and experimental methods, and one CSV-file with the associated results of the
structural distance analysis, all pertaining the project's default dataset 
['sample_data_random.csv'](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/test/sample_data_random.csv).
```
claudio_structdi -i c/user/documents/cross_links.csv -rt True -o "c/user/documents/outs"
```
This will result in the respective outputs into the directory "c/user/documents/outs" for the input dataset 
'cross_links.csv' using the temporary save files from the last execution (if this has not been run previously with the 
same input, this will return an error).
